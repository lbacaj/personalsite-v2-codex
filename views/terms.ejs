    the language stays simple and human.

    All copy, videos, products, and downloads are provided as-is without warranties. You may not redistribute paid products without
    explicit permission.

  <p>
    Subscribing authorizes us to send occasional updates. You can unsubscribe anytime using the link included in every email.
  </p>
  <h2>Giveaways</h2>
  <p>
    Giveaways will list eligibility rules, start/end dates, and fulfillment plans. Winners are selected fairly via the admin
    dashboardâ€™s random picker and announced via email.
  </p>
  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>
    Terms may evolve as the product grows. We will note material updates within the admin audit log and, when necessary, via the
