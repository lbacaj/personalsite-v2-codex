  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    This personal hub operates with first-party analytics only. We respect your inbox and privacyâ€”emails are stored securely in our
    self-hosted SQLite database, never sold, and removed immediately upon unsubscribe.
  </p>
  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Page analytics via the internal `/api/track` endpoint.</li>
    <li>Email subscriptions through the `/api/subscribe` endpoint.</li>
    <li>Giveaway entries submitted through forms on this site.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Analytics data includes the path, UTM parameters, user agent, and a salted hash of the IP address. No cross-site tracking or
    third-party scripts are used.
  </p>
  <h2>Email Communication</h2>
  <p>
    Emails are sent via Mailgun. Every campaign contains an unsubscribe link that immediately removes you from future sends while
    retaining a minimal compliance record.
  </p>
  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You may request deletion of your data at any time by replying to an email or contacting us directly. We will respond within 7
    days.
